# Optional Challenge: Implement Monitoring and Logging of Azure OpenAI using API Management Service

## Introduction:

This challenge requires a deep dive into the oversight of the Azure OpenAI Service. It entails utilizing the Log Analytics workspace to thoroughly monitor system performance and behavior. Additionally, it involves harnessing the capabilities of Azure API Management to ensure effective management and optimization of the service.

## Description:

In this particular challenge, your responsibilities will cover a series of actions. To start, you'll configure diagnostic settings, ensuring the system is adequately prepared for effective monitoring. Then, you'll move on to deploying an OpenAI model, a crucial step in implementing AI capabilities. Following this, your focus will shift to analyzing logs utilizing Kusto Queries, allowing for in-depth insights into system performance and behavior. Finally, you'll take on the task of monitoring OpenAI prompts, a pivotal aspect that involves leveraging the combined functionalities of Azure API Management and Log Analytics workspace to ensure the system's smooth and efficient operation.

## Challenge Objectives:

1. **Monitoring Azure OpenAI Service using Kusto query:**
   - Monitoring the Azure OpenAI Service involves configuring diagnostic settings, deploying an OpenAI model through Azure OpenAI, and conducting log analysis using Kusto Queries.
     
2. **Monitoring OpenAI prompts using Azure API Management:**
   - Overseeing OpenAI prompts in Azure API Management includes configuring the service, testing the API for chat message completions, and analyzing OpenAI logs using Kusto Queries within the API Management Service.
  
## Success Criteria:

Participants will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

1. The OpenAI service, including the successful deployment of the model, and the analysis of logs using Kusto Queries proceeded as expected.
2. The creation and configuration of Azure API Management, along with the analysis of logs using Kusto Queries within the API Management Service, occurred as expected.

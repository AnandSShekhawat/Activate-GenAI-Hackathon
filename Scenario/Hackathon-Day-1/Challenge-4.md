- In the chat application provide the below prompt and check how responses are given by the ChatGPT and Azure cognitive search services by interacting to construct search queries, and retrieve candidate information from the knowledge base.

   ```

   ```

- The response not only answered the question based on content found in these documents, but it has also included **citations (1)** to that content to validate the accuracy of the information. Click on an annotation, the app jumps right to the page of the **document (2)** that goes into the comparison of the plans, so that we can read more or do additional validation on the accuracy of the answer under the **citation** section. 


- See how when we click on an annotation, the app jumps right to the page of the document that goes into the comparison of the plans, so that we can read more or do additional validation on the accuracy of the answer. 

   ```
   Does the project manager manage the human resources team?
   ```

- As per our constructed app, we can pass context from previous parts of the chat into the prompt behind the scenes, which enables ChatGPT to answer the question if the project manager manages the human resources team. Click on the citation and you'll see the part of the plan that covers the related information.


**2. Multilingual Query Capability:**
   
- Let us make a slight change to the prompt to ask open AI to take any question that is not asked in English and respond in the language it was asked in. Go to **Developer Settings** and add the below message in the **Override prompt template** section. Click on **Close**.

  ```
   convert prompts to English and respond when asked questions in different language
   ```

- In this override, when we ask a question in a different language, behind the scenes, the prompt gets converted to English to perform the search, and then the model will respond in the same language it was asked in. Enter the below prompt in the chat section and observe it's taking the question, detecting that it's in French, converting it to English, executing it as before, and then returning the expected response like before.

   ```
   Quelles sont les responsabilitÃ©s du responsible marketing ?

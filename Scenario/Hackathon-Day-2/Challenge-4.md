# Challenge 04: Implement Chat App with Azure OpenAI LLM

## Introduction:
Welcome to the "Chat App Intelligence with Azure OpenAI LLM" challenge! In this hackathon, participants will dive into the world of conversational AI by creating a chat application infused with the power of Azure OpenAI Large Language Model (LLM). This challenge encourages participants to explore natural language understanding, generation, and interaction to enhance the user experience of a chat application.

## Description:
Imagine a chat app that not only facilitates communication but also understands and responds intelligently, making conversations more dynamic and engaging. Your task is to integrate Azure OpenAI LLM into a chat application, allowing it to comprehend user input, generate context-aware responses, and create a more natural and personalized conversational experience.

## Challenge Objectives

 **1. Access Web Application**
  - Click on "Browse" to open your web application.

**2. Explore Chatapp Interaction**
- In the chat application, provide the prompt: "What does a Product Manager do?"
    - Observe chatapp responses.
    - Explore annotations and citations in the response.
- Ask another question: "Does the project manager manage the human resources team?"
   - Note the influence of context on the response.
   - Click on citations to explore related information.

**3. Multilingual Query Capability**
- Modify the prompt in Developer Settings for multilingual queries.
   - Add the message: "Convert prompt to English and provide a response when asked a question in a different language."
   - Close the settings.
- Test multilingual query by asking in French:
   - Enter the prompt: "Quelles sont les responsabilit√©s du responsable marketing?"
   - Observe ChatGPT's conversion and response.

**4. Advanced Settings Implementation**

- In Developer Settings, enable "Use query-contextual summaries instead of whole documents" and "Suggest follow-up questions."
- Test the modified prompt:
   - Ask: "What happens in a performance review?"
   - Observe how advanced settings influence chat responses.


## Success Criteria:
Participants will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

   - Successfully navigate and explore the web application.
   - Demonstrate adept interaction with Chatapp through insightful questions and contextual exploration.
   - Showcase proficiency in multilingual queries, and implement advanced settings to influence chat responses, thereby displaying a comprehensive grasp of Azure OpenAI services.

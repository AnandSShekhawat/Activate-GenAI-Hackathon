# Optional Challenge: Implement Monitoring and Logging of Azure OpenAI using API Management Service

## Introduction:

Contoso Ltd aims to improve product support with a user-friendly chat application, leveraging AI technology, and making sure everything runs smoothly.

In this challenge, your team is diving into the details by using the Log Analytics workspace for a complete system check and performance analysis. You're starting by setting up an existing OpenAI service with diagnostic settings, making it easy to retrieve logs through Kusto queries. Simultaneously, You're establishing an API management service, adding essential values and configurations. This service connects with diagnostic settings, enabling Azure Monitor. Your next step is to analyze logs within the API management service using Kusto queries, ensuring effective monitoring and seamless integration with the OpenAI service. Your focus is on watching outputs and prompts to guarantee a well-integrated and monitored system.

## Challenge Objectives:

1. **Monitoring Azure OpenAI Service using Kusto query:**
   - Utilize the Azure OpenAI service by ensuring the diagnostic settings are configured and an OpenAI model is deployed.
   - Perform log analysis using Kusto Queries.
     
2. **Monitoring OpenAI prompts using Azure API Management:**
   - Configure Azure API Management by ensuring seamless chat message completions by navigating through the nuances of API testing.
   - Utilize the robust capabilities of Kusto queries within the API Management Service for advanced log analysis and in-depth examination of the queries generated.
  
## Success Criteria:

Participants will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

1. Verify the OpenAI service, ensuring the model deployment is successful, and analyze logs using Kusto Queries as planned.
2. Ensure Azure API management is created and configured ,resulting in the visibility of logs and OpenAI prompts using Kusto Queries.

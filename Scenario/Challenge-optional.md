# Optional Challenge: Implement Monitoring and Logging of Azure OpenAI using API Management Service

## Introduction:

This challenge requires a deep dive into the oversight of the Azure OpenAI Service. It entails utilizing the Log Analytics workspace to thoroughly monitor system performance and behavior. Additionally, it involves harnessing the capabilities of Azure API Management to ensure effective management and optimization of the service.

## Description:

In this challenge, you'll first set up diagnostic settings for thorough monitoring. Next, you'll deploy a key OpenAI model, a critical step in implementing AI capabilities. Then, you'll analyze logs using Kusto Queries, gaining insights into system performance. Finally, you'll monitor OpenAI prompts, leveraging Azure API Management and Log Analytics to ensure smooth system operation.

## Challenge Objectives:

1. **Monitoring Azure OpenAI Service using Kusto query:**
   - Monitoring the Azure OpenAI Service involves configuring diagnostic settings, deploying an OpenAI model through Azure OpenAI, and conducting log analysis using Kusto Queries.
     
2. **Monitoring OpenAI prompts using Azure API Management:**
   - Overseeing OpenAI prompts in Azure API Management includes configuring the service, testing the API for chat message completions, and analyzing OpenAI logs using Kusto Queries within the API Management Service.
  
## Success Criteria:

Participants will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

1. The OpenAI service, including the successful deployment of the model, and the analysis of logs using Kusto Queries proceeded as expected.
2. The creation and configuration of Azure API Management, along with the analysis of logs using Kusto Queries within the API Management Service, occurred as expected.

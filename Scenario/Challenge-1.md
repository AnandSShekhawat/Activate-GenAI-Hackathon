# Challenge 01:  Deploy Azure OpenAI Service and Large Language Models 

## Introduction:

Welcome to the Deploy Azure OpenAI Service and LLM Models Challenge! This challenge is designed to test your skills in deploying the Azure OpenAI Service and integrating Large Language Models into your applications. The goal is to set up the OpenAI Service, deploy LLM models, and demonstrate their usage in a practical scenario.

## Challenge Description:

Your task is to deploy the Azure OpenAI Service, integrate Large Language Models, and create a functional application that utilizes these models for natural language processing.

## Challenge Objectives:

1. **Azure OpenAI Service Deployment:**
   - Set up an Azure OpenAI Service instance in your Azure portal.
   - Configure and obtain necessary API keys and access credentials.

2. **Large Language Models (LLM) Integration:**
   - Choose a specific Large Language Model (e.g., GPT-3) for integration.
   - Implement code to interact with the OpenAI Service and make requests to the chosen LLM.

3. **Functional Application:**
   - Develop a functional application that demonstrates the capabilities of the deployed OpenAI Service and LLM.
   - Showcase natural language processing features, such as text generation, summarization, or question answering.


## Success Criteria:

- Successful deployment of Azure OpenAI Service.
- Integration of a Large Language Model (LLM) with the OpenAI Service.
- Development of a functional application demonstrating natural language processing capabilities.

## Additional Resources:

- Refer to the [Azure OpenAI Service documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/) for guidance on deploying the service.

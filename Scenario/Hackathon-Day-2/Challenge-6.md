# Challenge 06: Serverless Document Batch Processing 

## Introduction:

In this challenge, we provide you with the essential tools to explore Form Recognizer Service, OpenAI, and the Business Process Automation Accelerator. Our aim is to empower you to delve into the accelerator's capabilities for building pipelines across diverse services, crafting AI solutions aligned with your business needs. Your mission is to create a serverless document batch processing solution, utilizing Azure services and OpenAI embeddings. The solution should enable users to add documents in batches, process them for embeddings, and leverage these embeddings to enhance search and question-answering experiences. Get ready for an immersive and innovative hackathon experience!

## Challenge Objectives:

1) Ensure the creation of a language service, gain access to the studio, and specifically opt for document translation to facilitate a streamlined linguistic experience.

1) Configure precise source and target languages, selectively choose files for translation from the local system, and seamlessly define the destination for an efficient translation process.

1) Make use of the Azure AI services multi-service account to ensure the creation and initiation of a project.

1) Ensure thorough training by uploading specific files and conducting rigorous testing to validate the effectiveness of the implemented solution.

1) Forge a pipeline using a static web app, designate a document type for transformation into a Form Recognizer model, and guarantee smooth document ingestion for thorough processing.

1) Optimize data import with advanced indexing in the search service. Utilize the BPA Accelerator's search app for precise document retrieval.

## Success Criteria:

- Establish the project by configuring the service resource and linking the training data source effectively.
- The model successfully identified the respective field created in the preceding step, providing its confidence score.
- Confirm the accurate selection of the "Select a stage to add it to your pipeline configuration" option to align with the specific requirements of your pipeline configuration.
- The file retrieval operation was executed successfully, and the relevant document is displayed in the search results.

# Challenge 06: Serverless Document Batch Processing 

## Introduction:

Welcome to the Serverless Document Batch Processing Hackathon! This challenge, we've equipped you with the essential artifacts to explore the capabilities of the Form Recognizer Service, OpenAI, and the Business Process Automation Accelerator. Our goal is to empower you to gain insights into utilizing the accelerator for building pipelines across various services, creating AI solutions tailored to your business requirements. You'll find all the necessary files and code in this GitHub repository, enabling you to execute the Azure OpenAI and Form Recognizer BPA accelerator and enhance document analysis. Feel free to explore and innovate!

## Description:

Your task is to create a serverless document batch processing solution that leverages Azure services and OpenAI embeddings. The solution should allow users to add documents in batches, process them to generate embeddings, and use these embeddings for enhanced search and question-answering experiences.

## Challenge Objectives:

1) Make use of the Azure AI services multi-service account to ensure the creation and initiation of a project.

1) Ensure thorough training by uploading specific files and conducting rigorous testing to validate the effectiveness of the implemented solution.

1) Forge a pipeline using a static web app, designate a document type for transformation into a Form Recognizer model, and guarantee smooth document ingestion for thorough processing.

1) Optimize data import with advanced indexing in the search service. Utilize the BPA Accelerator's search app for precise document retrieval.

## Success Criteria:

- Establish the project by configuring the service resource and linking the training data source effectively.
- The model successfully identified the respective field created in the preceding step, providing its confidence score.
- Confirm the accurate selection of the "Select a stage to add it to your pipeline configuration" option to align with the specific requirements of your pipeline configuration.
- The file retrieval operation was executed successfully, and the relevant document is displayed in the search results.

## Additional Resources:

- Refer to the provided [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ruoccofabrizio/azure-open-ai-embeddings-qna) for the architecture and related resources.
- Explore the [Azure Cognitive Search Vector Search Overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/vector-search-overview) module for additional insights.

## Prerequisites:

- Familiarity with serverless computing, Azure Functions, and Azure Cognitive Search.
- Knowledge of scalable and efficient document processing.

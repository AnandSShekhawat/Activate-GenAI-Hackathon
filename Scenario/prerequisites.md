# Prerequisites:

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed and configured in CloudLabs provided Integrated Environment (JumpVM) which you are going to use through out the hackathon:

1. Create an **Azure OpenAI** resource with an SKU size of **S0**.

1. Copy the Azure OpenAI **Keys** and **Endpoint** to a notepad.

1. Deploy the **gpt-35-turbo** and **text-embedding-ada-002** models in your Azure OpenAI resource with **40k** Tokens per Minute Rate Limit.

1. Deploy an **AI Search** resource with Pricing tier of **Basic**.
      
4. **Development IDE:** Choose a preferred integrated development environment (IDE) for coding. Popular choices include Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, or any IDE that supports your programming language.

5. **Node.js:** Install [Node.js 14+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

6. **Git:** Install Git to clone and contribute to the repository. You can download Git from [here](https://git-scm.com/).

7. **Azure CLI:** The Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI) is useful for managing Azure resources from the command line. Install it from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

8. **Terraform:** [ Terraform v1.6.0 or later](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install)

   - **Python:** Install [Python 3.12.1](https://www.python.org/downloads)
     * **Important**: Python and the pip package manager must be in the path in Windows for the setup scripts to work.
     * **Important**: Ensure you can run `python --version` from console. On Ubuntu, you might need to run `sudo apt install python-is-python3` to link `python` to `python3`.

  9. Install [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)

Happy hacking!

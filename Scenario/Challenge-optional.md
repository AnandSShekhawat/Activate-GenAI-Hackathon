# Optional Challenge: Implement Monitoring and Logging of Azure OpenAI using API Management Service

## Introduction:

This challenge requires a deep dive into the oversight of the Azure OpenAI Service. It entails utilizing the Log Analytics workspace to thoroughly monitor system performance and behavior. Additionally, it involves harnessing the capabilities of Azure API Management to ensure effective management and optimization of the service.

## Description:

In this challenge, you'll first set up diagnostic settings for thorough monitoring. Next, you'll deploy a key OpenAI model, a critical step in implementing AI capabilities. Then, you'll analyze logs using Kusto Queries, gaining insights into system performance. Finally, you'll monitor OpenAI prompts, leveraging Azure API Management and Log Analytics to ensure smooth system operation.

## Challenge Objectives:

1. **Monitoring Azure OpenAI Service using Kusto query:**
   - Utilize the Azure OpenAI service by ensuring the diagonistic settings are configured and an OpenAI model is deployed.
   - Performing log analysis using Kusto Queries.
     
2. **Monitoring OpenAI prompts using Azure API Management:**
   - Configure Azure API Management by ensuring seamless chat message completions by navigating through the nuances of API testing.
   - Delve into OpenAI logs through Kusto Queries within the API Management Service.
  
## Success Criteria:

Participants will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

1. The OpenAI service, including the successful deployment of the model, and the analysis of logs using Kusto Queries progressed as anticipated.
2. Ensure Azure API management is created and configured ,resulting in the visibility of logs and openAI prompts using Kusto Queries.

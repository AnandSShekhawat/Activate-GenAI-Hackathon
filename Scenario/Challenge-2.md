# Challenge 02 :  Architecture Deployment with Terraform 

## Introduction:

Welcome to the Azure Architecture Deployment with Terraform Challenge! This challenge is designed to test your skills in deploying Azure infrastructure using Terraform. The goal is to deploy a given architecture utilizing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles and Terraform best practices.

## Challenge Description:

Your task is to deploy the architecture provided in the [Azure Activate GenAI GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/activate-genai) using Terraform. The architecture includes a set of Azure resources that form the foundation for an AI-driven solution.

## Challenge Objectives:

1. **Terraform Deployment:**
   - Use Terraform to deploy the architecture specified in the provided GitHub repository.
   - Configure Terraform scripts to provision Azure resources accurately.

2. **Resource Configuration:**
   - Define and configure Azure resources such as Virtual Networks, Virtual Machines, Storage Accounts, etc., as outlined in the architecture.

3. **Networking and Security:**
   - Implement networking components with proper connectivity and security configurations.
   - Ensure the correct setup of network security groups, subnets, and any required firewall rules.

4. **Best Practices and Modularity:**
   - Adhere to Terraform best practices, ensuring modularity, maintainability, and reusability of code.
   - Implement variables and modules where applicable to enhance code structure.

## Success Criteria:

- Successful deployment of the architecture using Terraform scripts.
- Correct configuration of Azure resources according to the provided architecture.
- Implementation of networking and security features as outlined.
- Adherence to Terraform best practices, modularity, and maintainability.

## Additional Resources:

- Refer to the  [Azure Activate GenAI GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/activate-genai) for detailed information on the architecture.

## Prerequisites:

- Proficiency in Terraform and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) concepts.
- Basic understanding of Azure services and networking.
